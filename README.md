Eric Huang (CS3560)
In this programming assignment, you will build a Java-based Mini Twitter with graphical user
interface (GUI) using Java Swing. This is going to be a pure desktop program, without web or
mobile components. The goal of this assignment is to let you experience how to apply design
patterns to build extensible software systems.
